{% highlight markdown %}
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
{% endhighlight %}

```python
def find_it(seq):
    w = dict.fromkeys(seq, -1)
    for i in seq:
        w[i]*=-1
    n = [key for key, switch in w.items() if switch > 0]
    return n[0]
```
