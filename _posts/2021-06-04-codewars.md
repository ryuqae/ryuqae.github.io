#1. Find the odd int
{% highlight markdown %}
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.
There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
{% endhighlight %}

```python
def find_it(seq):
    w = dict.fromkeys(seq, -1)
    for i in seq:
        w[i]*=-1
    n = [key for key, switch in w.items() if switch > 0]
    return n[0]
```

#2. Vowel count

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).
The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

```python
def getCount(inputStr):
    return sum(char in 'aeiou' for char in inputStr.lower())

    ```
